Let's read current README to rewrite. We'll follow constraints: headings and numbered steps; no hyphen bullets in normal sentences. We'll use numbered lists. We'll include troubleshooting with subsections. Must include exact commands and observed result "32 passed in <time>s" but they want exactly "32 passed in <time>s" where <time>s placeholder? They said final result 32 passed; our observed was 17.96s. We'll document exactly 32 passed in 17.96s maybe. They asked expected result must be documented exactly like this "32 passed in <time>s". That implies variable time; but they also said don't invent results and final result 32 passed. Better: put `32 passed in 17.96s` as example with note time may differ? But "do not invent results": we observed 17.96s here. But their Ubuntu might vary. But they insisted exact. We'll follow: show `32 passed in 17.96s` with note time varies; but uses bullet? We'll use numbered list. We'll add screenshot image reference: `![pytest success](screenshots/pytest-success.png)` with explanation. In markdown bullet not allowed? They said no hyphen bullets in normal sentences. Image line isn't bullet. Troubleshooting uses numbered subsections. Provide wrong path and correct fix commands. Also include mention of xmllint no output means success. Also mention sed extract. We'll update COMMANDS.md maybe already exists; ensure list-plugins output format now `<section>` not `\t`. It's updated earlier. We'll add to COMMANDS maybe not needed but they requested short note in README or COMMANDS about sync and read. We'll add in README. Also remove `.gitkeep`? should keep for folder? now we have png file, so .gitkeep not necessary; we can delete. We'll keep? Might not matter but extra file. We'll delete `.gitkeep` maybe. And update screenshot folder has png. Need ensure tracked. Let's apply patches. We'll do apply_patch sequentially. First add .gitignore and update requirements. but there is already requirements.txt in repo earlier; we modified to remove PySide6. Now we are to add minimum pytest and lxml. requirements.txt currently only lxml>=4.9.0? Wait earlier we changed requirements.txt to lxml only. Now requirement wants pytest and lxml unpinned unless already pins. existing pins? requirements.txt earlier had lxml>=4.9.0. We'll keep >=; but requirement says versions left unpinned unless already pins. since already has >=4.9.0. We'll add pytest. We'll not remove current. Let's read requirements.txt current. We'll use read_file quickly. We'll patch accordingly. We'll patch README. Let's tool calls. We'll apply patch for .gitignore new; update requirements; update README; update COMMANDS about output format maybe; ensure screenshot reference. We'll delete screenshots/.gitkeep. We'll run pytest to confirm still passes after docs changes.
